Mission Statement:
Our mission is to responsibly invest in the research, development, and regulated production of psychoactive substances that have potential therapeutic value.
Current drug schedules and prohibitions are overly restrictive, ideologically-driven, and disconnected from scientific evidence on the harms and benefits of many substances. Alcohol and tobacco, though legal and widely used recreationally, are in fact more harmful and addictive than many prohibited substances such as cannabis, psychedelics and empathogens. However, the established industries selling alcohol and tobacco wield enormous economic and political power, enabling them to evade strict regulation and maintain their market dominance.
We envision a future where psychoactives are scientifically evaluated and rationally classified based on their risks and benefits, free from cultural biases and institutional self-interest. An evidence-based approach will likely lead to the emergence of new markets for milder, less harmful recreational substances, providing alternatives to alcohol and tobacco. It will also enable the ethical medical and social use of psychoactives to relieve suffering, enhance wellbeing, and unlock human potential.
We are working to make this future a reality by being at the forefront of this transformation, steering drug production and use in a direction that maximizes benefits and reduces overall individual and societal harm. We will achieve this by supporting research to better understand the pros and cons of different substances, advocating for drug policy reforms aligned with scientific consensus, and providing consumers with the information and tools they need to make responsible, health-promoting choices.
Background:
The current legal and regulatory framework around recreational drugs, primarily focusing on alcohol and tobacco, and the drug scheduling system have historical, cultural, political, and economic roots. Here's an overview of why these frameworks can seem disconnected from the scientific evidence:
Historical Precedents:
Cultural Acceptance: Both alcohol and tobacco have deep cultural roots in many societies. Alcohol, for instance, has been consumed for thousands of years in religious ceremonies, social gatherings, and daily life across different civilizations.
Prohibition: The U.S. experimented with alcohol prohibition in the early 20th century. While it did lead to a reduction in alcohol consumption, it also gave rise to organized crime, underground markets, and increased law enforcement challenges. Prohibition was eventually repealed, further entrenching alcohol's legal status.
Economic Interests:
Major Industries: Both alcohol and tobacco industries have developed into multi-billion dollar sectors that employ millions and contribute significantly to national economies through taxes.
Lobbying Power: With significant resources, these industries have the means to lobby for their interests, which can influence policy decisions and regulatory frameworks.
Flawed Drug Scheduling:
Initial Classifications: Many drug classifications were established at times when the scientific understanding of these substances was less advanced. Once a substance is scheduled or prohibited, it becomes difficult to research, further entrenching misconceptions.
Sociopolitical Factors: The "War on Drugs," initiated in the 1970s in the U.S., was more of a political move than a scientifically-backed campaign. Many substances were banned or restricted without robust scientific evidence, sometimes due to cultural or racial biases. For instance, the criminalization of marijuana was, in part, fueled by racial and anti-immigrant sentiments.
Health Comparisons:
While tobacco and alcohol are legal, they are responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide. In comparison, many prohibited substances have a much lower potential for harm and even potential therapeutic benefits. This discrepancy underscores the inconsistency in how drugs are scheduled and regulated based on health risks.
Cultural Biases and Moral Panics:
Media and public perception can play a significant role. At times, certain substances become the focus of moral panics, where they are depicted as particularly dangerous or corrosive to societal values, even if scientific evidence doesn't support these claims.
Some substances are associated with particular cultural or minority groups, and their prohibition can be intertwined with issues of racism or xenophobia.
Research Limitations:
Due to strict regulations and the illegal status of many substances, scientific research into their effects (both harmful and beneficial) has been limited. This creates a catch-22 situation: substances remain illegal because there's not enough evidence of their safety or therapeutic benefits, but research that could provide such evidence is hindered by their illegal status.
Over time, these factors have contributed to a regulatory landscape that is often more reflective of historical, economic, and sociopolitical factors than of objective scientific evidence. However, with the growing body of research and a shift in societal attitudes, there's hope that future drug policies will be more in line with science and health outcomes.
Why crypto and why a DAO?
The intersection of cryptocurrencies/blockchain technology and the recreational substances industry is an intriguing one. There's a compelling synergy between the challenges faced by the substances industry and the solutions that crypto and blockchain can offer. Here's a deeper dive into why these two seemingly disparate fields might complement each other:
Payment Rails:
Banking Restrictions: As previously mentioned, businesses operating within the legal cannabis and psychedelics space often face challenges accessing traditional banking services due to the substances' federal illegality or restrictions in many jurisdictions.
Crypto Solution: Cryptocurrencies offer an alternative payment mechanism, enabling businesses to bypass traditional banking systems. Customers can pay for products using crypto, and businesses can use it for both their incoming revenue and outgoing expenses. This offers a level of financial freedom and flexibility that isn't typically available through traditional banking.
Supply Chain Management & Verifiable Tracking:
Traceability Concerns: Given the potential health impacts and the often tight regulations around recreational substances, ensuring the authenticity and quality of products is crucial. Tracking a product from its source to the end consumer can be a complex task, especially if multiple entities are involved in the supply chain.
Blockchain Solution: Blockchain, with its immutable ledger, can facilitate transparent and tamper-proof tracking of products. Every step of the product's journey can be logged on the blockchain, from cultivation or synthesis to final sale. This not only instills confidence in consumers about product quality but also aids in regulatory compliance.
Investments & Financial Sovereignty:
Bank Scrutiny: Investors and businesses in the recreational substances sector may face financial scrutiny, with banks sometimes freezing assets or blocking transactions due to the association with a stigmatized industry.
Crypto Solution: Cryptocurrencies provide a more autonomous form of financial ownership. Investments made in crypto are decentralized, meaning they aren't controlled by any single entity, like a bank. This reduces the risk of funds being arbitrarily frozen. Additionally, the use of smart contracts can automate and secure investment agreements, ensuring all parties adhere to the terms set out.
Decentralized Decision-Making:
Centralized Limitations: Traditional business models and investment structures often have centralized decision-making processes, which might not always cater to the interests of all stakeholders.
DAOs and Crypto: DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) operate on blockchain and leverage the principles of decentralization. Stakeholders can participate in decision-making processes, propose initiatives, and vote on important matters. This democratization can be especially valuable in industries like recreational substances, where community trust and involvement are vital.
Global Interactions:
Cross-Border Challenges: The legal status of recreational substances varies across countries. Businesses and investors interacting on a global scale can face regulatory and financial challenges.
Crypto Solution: Cryptocurrencies, by their decentralized nature, are not bound by national borders. This can facilitate smoother international transactions, partnerships, and investments without the complications of currency conversions or cross-border banking restrictions.
In essence, the challenges faced by the recreational substances industry due to its controversial nature and the evolving legal landscape make it a prime candidate to benefit from the solutions offered by crypto and blockchain technologies.

Governance:
1. Voting Power Allocation:
Based on your criteria:
Past Voting Performance (PVP): 50%
Contributions to the Collective Knowledge Base (CKB): 25%
Length of Time in the DAO (LTD): 25%
Total Voting Power (TVP) = PVP + CKB + LTD
2. Mechanisms & Formulas:
Past Voting Performance (PVP):
Each member starts with a neutral PVP score of 50% when they join.
For each successful investment decision, the member's PVP increases by a certain percentage (e.g., 0.5%).
For each unsuccessful investment decision, the member's PVP decreases by a certain percentage (e.g., 0.5%).
The PVP score is capped at 100% and has a minimum limit of 0%.
Formula:
PVPnew=PVPcurrent±%(based on investment success or failure)
Contributions to the Collective Knowledge Base (CKB):
Members earn CKB points for each verified contribution they make.
The magnitude of these points can vary based on the quality and significance of the contribution.
Every month, members can earn up to a maximum of 2.5%, meaning in a year they can achieve the full 25% (if they consistently contribute valuable insights).
Formula:
CKBnew=CKBcurrent+(Points earned based on contribution)
Length of Time in the DAO (LTD):
Members gain LTD points based on their duration in the DAO.
For instance, for each month of membership, they can earn 2.08% (so that in a year, they would accumulate the full 25%).
Formula:
LTDnew=LTDcurrent+2.08
3. Decentralized Investment Process:
Members propose investments, and these proposals are open for voting by all DAO members based on their TVP.
Once a proposal reaches a certain threshold of approval (e.g., 60%), the investment is made.
The results of these investments impact the PVP of the members who voted for or against them.
4. Rewards and Penalties:
Members who vote for successful investments gain increased ownership and voting power, while those who vote for unsuccessful investments face reduced ownership and voting power.
A potential mechanism can be implemented where the DAO allocates a portion of its profits from successful investments as rewards to members based on their TVP. Those who had higher PVP (because they consistently made good choices) would thus earn a more significant share.
